Title: Unsupervised Identification of Genes with Expression Loss in Subsets of Tumors
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Pique
Maintainer: Daniel Pique <daniel.pique@med.einstein.yu.edu>
Description: receptLoss identifies genes whose expression is lost in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue. 
    It is particularly well-suited in cases where the number of normal tissue samples is small, as the distribution
    of gene expression in normal tissue samples is approximated by a Gaussian. Originally designed
    for identifying nuclear hormone receptor expression loss but can be applied transcriptome wide as well.
